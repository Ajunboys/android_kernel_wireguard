# Standalone WireGuard Tools for Android

This compiles and creates a tarball which you can use to install the
WireGuard tools into an existing ROM via root.

## Installation

Type `make`, copy the resulting `.tar.gz` to your device, and as root,
run `sh ./install.sh`. The installation should survive ROM reflashes.
